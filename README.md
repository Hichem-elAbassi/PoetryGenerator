# PoetryGenerator
Artificially intelligent program that generates poetry basing on your face's attributes. Project currently in development phase.
## Description
Using a huge database of poetic verses in many languages , the program (after selecting the targeted language) will prompt for a picture (the idea is to get it from mobile client's camera or a webcam).
Then through extracted classifiers (typically keywords - eyes color , hair color , face shape etc..)it will query the databases for relevent verses , set up a form according to the emotion detected in the picture and return a full poem .
##Great idea would be:
1.Mobile apps !
2.Web apps!
3.Sound reading the generated poem!
3.1.Learn the vocals of the user and use it to train the ANN in order to read poem in your voice without actually intervening!
